The output of the path planners should follow these commands

-1 : move : `-1 X Y` -- move brush to (X,Y) position
-2 : lift : -- lift brush up from contact with canvas 
-3 : drop -- start painting
-4 : refill : `-4 initial_x initial_y color` -- 
-5 : change color : `-5 initial_x initial_y initial_color new_color` 


The brush does not store its position, so it needs to be passed repeatedly in the refill and change color commands.
